				<h1>Comment Policy</h1>
				<p>This is just a few rules to ensure the discussions in the comments don't go off track.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't be a jerk.</li>
					<li>Don't use slurs. (Includes comments with embedded OneJoke&trade; technology)</li>
					<li>Try to be constructive.</li>
					<li><del>Try to include at least three numbers or one symbol in your comment.</del></li>
					<li>Don't promote your stuff unless it's on-topic and helpful.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you violate any of these rules, I'll probably delete your comment -- or worse, ban you! Oh no.</p>
			</div>
