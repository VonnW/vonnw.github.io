# Hello, world!

I'm Vonn Wheatley, a computer scientist studying at Kent State University. I'm good at a little bit of everything, but I mostly focus in game development.

## Things I've worked on

* [TetroNet](https://tetronetkhe.github.io/TetroNet/), an AI that can learn to play a block-arranging game. Built for Kent Hack Enough 2019, and won Best Beginner Hack!
* Also everything on my other site.
* Expect more stuff to show up soon!

## What's the point of this site?

I'll hopefully get a blog up and running soon, and I'll put a few updates and tutorials there. Also, this will function as a sort of portfolio. When I do enough projects, I'll make this front page fancier, I promise!

## Anything else?

I'm on Twitter as [@VonnW](https://twitter.com/VonnW) (formerly @VonnWheatley), but I don't post ~~that often~~ anything there. I'm also on GitHub as [@VonnW](https://github.com/VonnW)!
